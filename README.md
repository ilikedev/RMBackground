> only the main object will be visible, all the rest will be
> transparent. For example, it can be useful when you want to download
> an icon to put it in a slideshow but unwanted white outlines are
> present.

## History
> This is the new version of an old tool named "Remove-BG-Desktop-App"

**However, there are many differences:** 

 - âœ”**Fixed** blurry text bug when changing DPI scale
 - âœ”Bug in the window which freezes when removing the background **fixed**.
 - âœ”More **stable** application.
 - ~~Application created fasterðŸ˜…~~
But what pushed me to go so far as to create a new repos **was the poor organization of the old one**.
